House Landing Page

This project took a week to complete. It is a basic landing page with a theme for VR house auctions. The project was mainly built with Bootsrap 5 and Javascript. I also added additional CSS styling. I learned mostly how to use bootstrap by using a few of the components available. The project was a challenge as I am used to only use CSS to style. The documentation on Bootstrap's site is very clear and I had to read up on how to use the framework during the completion of this project.

The House landing page is responsive with a small dropdown navbar with links that can be clicked on to take the user to different sections of the page when using a smaller screen. I also learned how to create a wave effect in CSS and used it between sections of the site.

This project consist of two mini Javascript projects namely a Countdown timer and a currrent Bitcoin price displayer.
I learned how to use axios in a basic manner to get the price of bitcoin using a free API from a cryptocurrency site. I used async await in a function to display the price in a div I created. The Countdown timer was created using newDate (object) and a few math calculations to get the days, hours, minutes and seconds. I also used setInterval to get the seconds of the clock to change every second.
